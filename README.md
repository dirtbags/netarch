Dirtbags Netarch Library
========================

This is a library for advanced
[network archaeology](https://sites.google.com/view/cyberfire/foundry/classes/network-archaeology).

It provides a heavily field-tested framework for
exploring unknown TCP-based protocols,
and room to grow these explorations into full-blown decoders.

=========

Documentation sucks, sorry.
The way we go about things is to copy `dumbdecode.py` to a new file,
and start hacking onto it.
