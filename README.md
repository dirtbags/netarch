Dirtbags Netarch Library
========================

This is a library for advanced
[network archaeology](https://sites.google.com/view/cyberfire/foundry/classes/network-archaeology).

It provides a heavily field-tested framework for
exploring unknown TCP-based protocols,
and room to grow these explorations into full-blown decoders.

=========

Documentation doesn't exist. Sorry.
The way we go about things is to copy [dumbdecode](examples/dumbdecode.py) to a new file,
and start hacking onto it.

You may find the [example xmodem decoder](examples/xmodem.py) to be helpful!
It illustrates a fair amount of what the library provides.
